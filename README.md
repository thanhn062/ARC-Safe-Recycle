# 🧭 ARC Safe Recycle
*A lightweight helper to quickly check what’s safe to recycle in **ARC Raiders** — without alt-tabbing!*

---

## 🎮 Why I Made This
I built this little tool with ChatGPT because I got tired of **guessing what’s safe to recycle** or constantly **alt-tabbing** between browser guides and the game window.  
Now I can just press a key and instantly see what’s safe — right inside ARC Raiders.

## 🧩 How to Use

1. **Press `Ctrl + F`** while the ARC Raiders window is active to open the search.  
2. **Type an item name** — if it doesn’t show up in the list, it’s safe to recycle.  
3. **Press `Esc`** to hide the window.  
4. Repeat anytime — the results update instantly.

💡 **Tip:** Use the **Settings** button to adjust your workstation levels or expedition phase.  
It filters out items you already no longer need.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ **Auto-download latest data**  
Fetches the newest `hideoutModules.json` and `projects.json` from [RaidTheory’s GitHub](https://github.com/RaidTheory).

🔍 **Instant fuzzy search**  
Type any partial name — results appear in real time.

🧱 **Smart filtering**  
Automatically excludes items from completed workstations or expedition phases.

💡 **Portable, no install**  
Just drop the `.exe` anywhere and run — no setup, no dependencies.

## 🪶 Notes & Known Quirks

- On first use, the search window might not auto-focus — just click it once.  
- Occasionally the app won’t close cleanly; if that happens, end it via **Task Manager**.  
- Since the `.exe` isn’t signed, Windows might show a warning. It’s safe — or you can compile it yourself.
